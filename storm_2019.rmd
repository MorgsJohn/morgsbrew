> I put together a short video with footage from my farm during the last rain event. We had some serious rain here over the Easter period. During the final surge, after there had already been 450 mm and there is a lot of runoff, I was running around filming it. I recorded 472 mm in a 48-hour event which has claimed at least 51 lives in KZN. This video is not about the floods but more specifically how the rains impacted the Farm I live on. I took a run through the farm in KZN during the last wave of the storm to investigate. It was late afternoon and just getting dark so I had to add some trickery to the footage to improve visibility. I added the approximate catchment size for reference which was calculated using Google Earth Pro. I have never seen water to this scale on this property and neither has my father (83 this year). We were very fortunate to be safe during this event but there are many people in the provinces who have suffered. You can check it out on my YouTube Channel.

On Easter Monday 2019 the provinces KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape experienced torrential rain. There is extensive damage across both provinces with continued aid being required for the people whose lives have been changed.
